## My Favortie CPSC 120 LAB'S

* Lab 9

    In Lab 9, Part 1, I developed a program to compute the average rating of an ice skiing performance based on the assessment from five judges. The algorithm I created involved excluding the highest and lowest scores before calculating the mean of the remaining three. This program enhanced my proficiency in using vectors and strings. The process of combining mathematical algorithms to achieve the desired computational outcome was the best part of the design. The lab contributed to my practical understanding of programming principles.

* Lab 7

    In Lab 7, Part 2, I was tasked to output various parking times for a number of neighborhood streets. I made use of incorporating bool statements, strings, and arguments to verify street parking times. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge and practically of the program.

* Lab 11

    In Lab 11, Part 2, This program was the most enjoyable as it was a simple game. The program involved a random number generator. My favorite part of the program was learning how to create a simple game using the library “rng.h”. The most rewarding part of my creation was taking a step forward in my career of being a game developer.
